JugheadBot is a Facebook Messenger Bot application that I wrote to learn about ChatBots.

## What does JugheadBot do
--------------------------
Once you start chatting with JugheadBot, he can basically answer simple questions like:
* Where can I find the best restaurants in Mahim, Mumbai
* Where can I find Chinese restaurants in Kothrud, Pune



JugheadBot Internals
--------------------
JugheadBot is a Python Django application which uses the [Facebook Messenger Platform APIs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) to chat with users and the [Zomato API](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#/) to fetch information about the Restaurants. It also does NLP and ML using Google's [API.ai](https://api.ai) framework
